## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate AI and Data Science enthusiast focused on understanding how data is collected, cleaned, manipulated, and transformed using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

I am currently learning how machine learning models are trained, evaluated, and optimized using real-world datasets. My primary interest lies in Large Language Models (LLMs) and how they can be integrated into intelligent web systems.

Alongside AI, I work on web development and explore how AI-powered features can enhance modern applications by making them smarter, scalable, and user-focused.
